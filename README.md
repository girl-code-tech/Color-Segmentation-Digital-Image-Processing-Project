# Color-Segmentation-Digital-Image-Processing-Project
This DIP project gets its idea from a movie where the hero gets invisible whenever he puts on a red blanket. So does this project implement the idea, for wherever it finds the red color, it transforms the red region to black. This is a color segmentation based DIP project.
